SonarQube
---------
Open source continous code quality integration tool

Identify 
	Code quality
	Bugs
	Code vulnerabilities
	
e.g. 
	Define rules for different code bases.

	Software Testing
		
	Testing Type
		Manual
		Automatic
		
	Testing Methods
		Static
		Dynamic
		
	Testing Approaches
		Black Box
		White Box
			knows internal structure
		Gray Box
			Knows little bit of internal structure
	
	Testing Levels
		Unit Testing
		Integration Testing
		System Testing

	Static Analysis
		During development
		Early testing
		
	Why static code analysis
		Cost of defect increases with time.
		Find errors earlier in development
		Detects over complexity in code
		Find Security Errors
		Enforces Best Coding practices
		Automated and integrates in jenkins
		Can create project specific rules
		
	E.g of static testing tools
		SonarQube
		Coverity
		Pycharm
